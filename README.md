AHK for Radiology

Credit to Ben White for the original scripts. These are derived from his original work. 

These are just some simple radiology scripts to streamline your workflow. It runs on the older version of AHK (Version 1.1). This may need to be downloaded to a USB drive and run as a portable file, depending on your workplace's IT rules and regulations.

Feel free to add new functions, and I will hopefully provide certain updates as well!
